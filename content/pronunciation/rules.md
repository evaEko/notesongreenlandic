### Basic Rules

*   "ti" is pronounced as \[tsi\]
* **Two vowels**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long
* **o** and **u**, and **i** and **e**
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;u becomes o if followed by q or r
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i becomes e if followed by q or r
    Orthographic combinations ur, uq, ir, iq do not exist.
  _ulloq-innaq ->ulluinnaq_
  _kingullilik -> kingulleq-lik_


### Assimilation Rules
*   If there are two consonants, the second one assimilates the first one: \[c1\]\[c2\] -> \[c2\]\[c2\]
    
    For example: Ilisimatusarfik + mi => IlisimatusarfiMMi
    
    vv -> pp
*   Two v, l, g, and r characters become unvoiced (for example [illit](pronunciation.html)); vv -> pp/kk
*   rg and qg become r; for example: nuliaq + ga => nuliara
*   when a+\[vowel\] => aa
    
    _This does not apply if the "a" is the final letter of a word_: ataata +i -> ataatai
* ...uva... -&gt; ua (taku +vara -&gt; takuara)
