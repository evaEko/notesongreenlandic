### Basic Rules

* **Two vowels**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long
* **o** and **u**, and **i** and **e**
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;u becomes o if followed by q or r
   * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i becomes e if followed by q or r
    Orthographic combinations ur, uq, ir, iq do not exist.
     * `ulloq-innaq -> ulluinnaq`
     * `kingullilik -> kingulleq-lik`
* loan and foreign words append `i` when adding a suffix (repair strategy):
  * `56-inik`
  * `Thor+mik -> Thorimik`
* When adding a suffix starting with `t`, `t` becomes `s` if the stem ends with a vowel:
  * taa + tar + vaat -> taasarpaat
  * suli + toq -> sulisoq 


### Assimilation Rules
*   If there are two consonants, the second one assimilates the first one: \[c1\]\[c2\] -> \[c2\]\[c2\]
    
    For example: Ilisimatusarfik + mi -> IlisimatusarfiMMi
    
    vv -> pp
*   Two v, l, g, and r characters become unvoiced (for example [illit](pronunciation.html)); vv -> pp/kk; gg -> kk
*   rg and qg become r; for example: nuliaq + ga => nuliara
*   when a+\[vowel\] => aa
    
    _This does not apply if the "a" is the final letter of a word_: ataata +i -> ataatai
*   pg becomes kk; for example: ilinniartip+galuar+vaa -> ilinniartikkaluarpaa
*   when a+\[vowel\] => aa
* ...uva... -> ua (taku +vara -&gt; takuara)
* ...uvi... -> ui

  * _Nuummiu+u+vit_ -> `Nuummiuuit`; _Maniitsoq+miu+u+vit_ -\> Maniitsormiuuit
* `t` between two vowels becomes `n`:
  * `_kungi+mut+una_ -> kungimuNuna`:  king singular + terminalis/allative + here is
* `tv` and `tp` become `l`:
  * sammisari + niar=nngit +viuk -> sammisarinianngiliuk
* `k` between two vowels becomes `ng`:
  * Kangerlussuaq+miu-u+niar+contemporative 3 pl +una -> `Kangerlussuarmiuuniarlutinguna`
* `q` between two vowel becomes `j`????:
  * `qalunaajuvoq`
