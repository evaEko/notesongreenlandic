It is coreferential *only*: the subject of the participle clause *is the same*
as the subject of the superordinate clause (it was Bernard who was buttering the toast *and*
vowing). If the subject is different, use the particle.

It expresses something that the subject of the superordinate clause is doing:
* It is equivalent to *participle phrases*, such as, "*Buttering toast with a fork*,
Bernard vowed that he would finally wash the week's worth of dirty dishes piled in the sink."
* It is used in the coordination like `A v1 B and A v2`: v2 will be in contemporative.
* Expresses the circumstances, typically expressed by adverbs in English, such as, `It was pleasantly warm` : `It was warm being pleasant` -> ``TODO

The suffix is `(l)lu + person suffix` the `lu` meaning *that the subject of the superordinate clause does* (if there is no `ll` or equivalent, such as `rl`, an `l` is added).

It can be transitive or intransitive depending on the verb used in contemporative clause: in intranstive, it defines the subject; in transitive the object of the subordinate clause.

## Contemporative Transitive

Expresses `Subject V1 that/and Subject V2 Object`:
The subject is not clear without the superordinate clause cause it is not expressed
 only the object is expressed by the suffix.
The form expresses the object of the action only!
