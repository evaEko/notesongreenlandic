Expresses something that the subject of the superordinate clause is doing.

It is equivalent to *participle phrases*, such as, "*Buttering toast with a fork*,
Bernard vowed that he would finally wash the week's worth of dirty dishes piled in the sink."

It is coreferential *only*: the subject of the participle clause *is the same*
as the subject of the superordinate clause (it was Bernard who was buttering the toast *and*
vowing). If the subject is different, use the particle.

The suffix is `(l)lu + person suffix` the `lu` meaning that the subject of the superordinate clause does
(if there is no ll or equivalent, such as rl, an l is added).

It can be transitive or intransitive depending on the verb used in contemporative clause.

## Contemporative Transitive

Expresses `Subject V1 that/and Subject V2 Object`:
The subject is not clear without the superordinate clause cause it is not expressed
 only the object is expressed by the suffix.
The form expresses the object of the action only!
