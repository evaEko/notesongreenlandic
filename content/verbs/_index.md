Verbs' behavior is mainly determined by its transitivity. Transitivity is the ability of a verb to bind a direct object (object with no preposition; in Slovak, the accusative case):

* I am reading: *read* is intransitive in this sentence
* I am reading a book: *read* is transitive.
* I am sleeping: *sleeping* is intransitive (and cannot be transitive: <s>I am sleeping it</s>).

Similarly in Greenlandic:

* `Sinnippoq` ([intransitive indicative](intransitiveindicative)): he sleeps/slept (sinnik + voq); <s>Sinnippaanga</s>
* `Eqqaamavaanga` ([transitive indicative](transitiveindicative)): he remembers me (eqqaama + vaanga); <s>Eqqaamavoq</s>

Based on transitivity, the respective transitive of intransitive paradigm is used for the verb.
