Verb is negated by adding `-nngit` to the stem. Some wild combinations can
appear at the end border and the verbal suffix:
_ajor-nngit+poq_ -> ajunngitpoq -> `Ajunngilaq` 

The `va` and `vu` suffixes become `la` when immediately preceded by `nngit`.
Otherwise general rules apply, for example, `suli-nngit+tunga` -> `sulinngitsunga`
