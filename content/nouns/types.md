The type decides the declension rules (not derivation) for ± morphemes.

* _P-nouns_:
  * -p in Relative
    arnaq: -p  
    ukioq (year), ukiup (year's), ukiut (years)
    
    BUT does not apply to derivation
* _UP-nouns_:
  * +/-up in Relative
    Whether it is + or - varies from noun to noun
    * `-fik`: +up
    * `-suaq`: -up
    * `-innaq`: +up


eqqumiitsuliortoq±mi: (p noun)
eqqumiitsuliortumi (uses **-**mi, not +mi)

**Note:**
Schwa is not orthographically marked and is disappearing. However, words like angut, taagut, don't end in t but in schwa. This becomes evident in words like taaguutaa (taaguutə + a), angutaavoq (angutə + u +poq)
