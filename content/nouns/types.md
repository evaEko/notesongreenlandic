The type decides the declension rules (not derivation) for ± morphemes.

* _P-nouns_:

  * -p in singular relative, 
  * -t in plural absolutive and relative
    
  * -nnguak: -p  
  ~~~~~
  ukioq (year), ukiup (year's), ukiut (years and years')
  ~~~~~

    DOES not apply to derivation
* _UP-nouns_: ±up in Relative ±it in plural absolutive and relative
    * +up/+it:
      * `-innaq`: +up
      * `+neq`: +up

      ~~~~~~
      inuk (man), inup (man's), inuit (men and mens')
      ~~~~~~
    * -up/-it:
      * `+fik`: -up
      * `-suaq`: -up

      ~~~~~
      siulleq (the first), siulliup (the first one's), siulliit (the first ones, the first ones')
      ~~~~~
      
    Whether it is + or - varies from noun to noun

**Note:**
Schwa is not orthographically marked and is disappearing. However, words like angut, taagut, don't end in t but in schwa. This becomes evident in words like taaguutaa (taaguutə + a), angutaavoq (angutə + u +poq)

**Example**
~~~~~~
eqqumiitsuliortoq±mi: (p noun)
eqqumiitsuliortumi (uses **-**mi, not +mi)
~~~~~~
